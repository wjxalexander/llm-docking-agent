## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, specific names for variables, functions, and classes. Favor readability over brevity.
  - Variables/Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `docking_score_threshold`).
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `DockingAnalyzer`).
  - Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`).
- **Logical Layout**: Use whitespace to group related operations and separate logical sections. Follow PEP 8 for indentation (4 spaces).
- **Strong Verb-Noun Pairs**: Functions should be named using a strong verb and a clear noun (e.g., `parse_ligand_file`).
- **Simplicity & Readability**: Prefer straightforward code over "clever" solutions. Code should be self-documenting.
- **Defensive Programming**: Validate inputs and handle edge cases or errors early (fail-fast).
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions to explain *what* they do. Use comments to explain *why* something is done if it's not obvious.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function or class should focus on a single, well-defined task.
