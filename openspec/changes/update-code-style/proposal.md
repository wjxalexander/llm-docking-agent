## What Changes
- Updated `openspec/project.md` with specific code style rules based on "Code Complete 2".
- Introduced rules for naming, layout, simplicity, and defensive programming.
- Aligned these principles with Pythonic best practices (PEP 8).

## Impact
- Affected files: `openspec/project.md`
- Future code development will follow these conventions.
